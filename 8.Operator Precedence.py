print(8 >> 4 - 2)

"""
Bitwise right shift has a lower precedence than subtraction, and we need to calculate the subtraction first.
The calculation above reads 8 >> 2 = 2

More explanation:
The >> operator moves each bit the specified number of times to the right. Empty holes at the left are filled with 0's.

If you move each bit 2 times to the right, 8 becomes 2:
 8 = 0000000000001000
becomes
 2 = 0000000000000010

The ^ operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if only one is 1, otherwise (if both are 1 or both are 0) it is set to 0:
